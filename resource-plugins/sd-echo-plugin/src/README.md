# Echo plugin

This directory contains a build for a dummy plugin which
just echos its inputs to its outputs upon provision.  It is somewhat pedantic
in how it does that to help build real provisioners from this base.

# Notes

- The go package "signadot.com/echo-plugin" is not go gettable, see Makefile for build.
